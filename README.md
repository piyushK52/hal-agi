# HAL - AI personal assistant

## How does it works?
The idea behind Hal is simple. For every task it creates a tree with sub-tasks and then recursively solves them to get the final output.

## What's Next
The goal is develop this into a complete personal assistant with multiple third party integrations and human like conversations. Listing some of them below
- Add web search functionality
- Add local directory search functionality (supporting multiple file types)
- Add emotion engine with context history
- Add new integrations through Langchain (or Microsoft's upcoming tool)
